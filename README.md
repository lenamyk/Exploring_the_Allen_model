# Exploring_the_Allen_model

This repository provides code and files related to the Master thesis "Exploring a Model of the Mouse Primary Visual Cortex" by Lena Myklebust.

Scripts are mainly used for analysing simulation output from the Primary Visual Cortex model developed by the Allen Institute for Brain Science, see https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/models/mv1-all-layers.

The folder adapted_from_Allen_Institute contains files adapted from the original LGN model, developed by the Allen Institute. Files include those which were modified to create the M1 and M2 LGN models used in the Master thesis. A full modified version of the Allen LGN model is also included, retrieved and adapted from the Allen Institute's Dropbox.
