This folder contains files adapted from the LGN model developed by the Allen Institute. A full modified version of the Allen LGN model is also included.

The folder "Modifications_M1_and_M2_models" include files which were modified to create the M1 and M2 LGN models 
used in my master thesis "Exploring a Model of the Mouse Primary Visual Cortex".
